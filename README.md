```
VisionKernel

VisionKernel is a comprehensive web application developed using Django framework. It incorporates various features such as user authentication, data retrieval from APIs, data visualization, and machine learning tasks. The application aims to provide a platform for managing and analyzing data from multiple sources, visualizing it using interactive charts and graphs, and applying machine learning techniques for further analysis and predictions.

## Features

- User Authentication: The application includes a user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- API Data Retrieval: It facilitates the retrieval of data from multiple APIs by providing a configurable mechanism to specify API endpoints, authentication details, and data retrieval intervals.
- Data Visualization: The application provides interactive data visualization capabilities using JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or D3.js. Users can explore and analyze the retrieved data through visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables.
- Machine Learning: It includes functionality for creating, training, and evaluating machine learning models. Users can perform tasks such as classification, regression, or prediction on the available data using popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configuration

- API Configuration: Update the API configurations in `config.py` to specify the API endpoints, authentication details, and data retrieval intervals. Customize it according to the APIs you want to integrate with.
- Data Visualization: Customize the data visualization components in the respective app's templates and views. Use JavaScript libraries and Django template tags to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
- Machine Learning Models: Modify the machine learning models and tasks based on your specific requirements. Utilize popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to implement and train the models.
